# Computer_vision-Image

## Introduction
Hey! I am Kartik Gupta.<br />
I have made this repository about using basic features of [Computer Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) Library.

***

## Requirments
* Any IDE ([VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) or [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download)) for running Python
* Python version [3.6.0](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or higher
* [Cv2](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) & [Numpy](https://numpy.org/install/) modules to be installed.

***

## **Codes**
1. [Canny Image](1.py)
2. [Grayscale Image](2.py)
3. [HSV Image](3.py)
4. [Video or Webcam](4.py)
5. [All Type Image](5.py)
6. [Stacking Images](6.py)

***

## **Explanation**
***
* **[1st Code](1.py)**

**Inputs** - The code requires the path within double inverted commas to be changed by path of any Image path.

**Working** - The code uses [Canny](https://docs.opencv.org/master/da/d22/tutorial_py_canny.html) function of opencv library to find Edges of a particular Image.

**Results** - It displays Edges of the Given Images & print an Image with Edges.

**Applications** - It is used in various Shapedetector Projects to count the Edges.

**The Output is as shown below** <br />

***
* **[2nd Code](2.py)**

**Inputs** - The code requires the path within double inverted commas to be changed by path of any Image path.

**Working** - The code uses cvt color function of cv2 library to convert color of Image to Grayscale.

**Results** - It displays the RGB image you provided in Grayscale format.

**Applications** - It is used while making various projects based on Computer Vision .

**The Output is as shown below** <br />
